Enables the Contact Form 7 plugin to create multi-page, multi-step forms.

== Description ==

I needed a contact form that spanned across multiple pages and in the end would send an email with all the info collected.  This plugin adds onto the popular Contact Form 7 plugin to do just that.

Sample of this working is at [https://webheadcoder.com/contact-form-7-multi-step-form/](https://webheadcoder.com/contact-form-7-multi-step-form/)

Requires the [Contact Form 7 plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), version 4.8 or above, by Takayuki Miyoshi.

**Usage**

1. Create one page or post for each step in your multi-step form process.  If you have 3 steps, create 3 pages/posts.  You will need the urls to these when creating your forms.

1. Create a Contact Form 7 form.

1. Place your cursor at the end of the form.

1. On the "Form" tab of the Contact Form 7 form, click on the button named "multistep".

1. In the popup, type in the current step and total steps in your multi-step process.  For example, if this is the first form in a total of 3 forms, type in "1" for Current Step and "3" in Total Steps.  If this is the last form in your process, type in "3" for current Step and "3" in Total Steps.

1. The Next Page URL is the url that contains your next form.  If this form is the last step, you can leave the URL field blank or fill it in to redirect the user to some other page.

1.  Click "Insert Tag"

1.  Save your completed form and place the form's shortcode into the appropriate Page/Post you created in step 1.

1.  Repeat for **each form** in your multi-step form process.  

1.  Only the final step will send an email.  To include fields from your other forms simply enter the mail-tags from the other forms.  For example if your first form has the field `your-email` you can include `[your-email]` in the Mail tab on the last form.


**Additional Tags**
`[multiform "your-name"]` - The `multiform` form-tag can be used to display a field from a previous step.  Replace `your-name` with the name of your field.

`[previous "Go Back"]` - The `previous` form-tag can be used to display a button to go to a previous step.  Replace `Go Back` with text you want to show in the button.


**What this plugin DOES NOT do:**  

* This plugin does not support file uploads on every form.  If you need to use file uploads make sure to place it on the last step.  

* This plugin currently does not support "pipes" in the select field.  See https://contactform7.com/selectable-recipient-with-pipes/ for more on what "pipes" is on the Contact Form 7 site.  

* This plugin does not load another form on the same page.  It only works when the forms are on separate pages.  Many have asked to make it load via ajax so all forms can reside on one page.  This plugin does not support that.


**PRO Version**
If you expect to have a lot of data submitted through your multi-step forms, the Pro version may be able to help you better.  The PRO version uses Session Storage so it is able to handle roughly 1,000 times more data for your multiple forms.  In total it can handle about 5MB vs 4KB in the free version.  **Currently the Pro version REQUIRES the WordPress REST API and Contact Form 7 AJAX Submission to be enabled.**   

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The Next button doesn't show up =
Like all Contact Form 7 forms, you still need to add a button to submit the form.  Use the normal submit button with any label you want like so `[submit "Next"]`.

The `multistep` form tag is a hidden field and tries not to add any spacing to your form.  In this effort, anything directly after this tag may be hidden.  To prevent this, add a carriage return after the `multistep` form tag, or just follow the directions and place the form tag at the end of the form.

= I keep getting the "Please fill out the form on the previous page" message.  What's wrong? =

If you have everything set up correctly and you get a message saying, "Please fill out the form on the previous page" after submitting the first form, then could be one of two reasons:
1. Your Caching system is not allowing cookies to be set in a normal way.  No workarounds or fixes are planned at this time.  You will need to turn off caching for the affected pages.
2. Your protocol or domain is not the same on all pages.  Each page that holds a form needs to have the same protocol and domain.  If your first page uses https like https://webheadcoder.com, your second page cannot be http:// or a subdomain of that.


= How can I show a summary of what the user entered or show fields from previous steps? =

`[multiform "your-name"]`  
The multiform form-tag can be used to display a field from a previous step.  Replace `your-name` with the name of your field.

= My form values aren't being sent in the email.  I get [multiform "your-name"] instead of the actual person's name. =

The multiform form-tag should only be used on the Form tab.  On the Mail tab follow the instructions from the Contact Fom 7 documentation.  So if you wanted to show the `your-name` field, type `[your-name]`.

= Can I have an email sent on the first step of the multi-step forms? =

Yes, you can, but it requires you to add code to your theme's functions.php file.  See this forum post for more details:
[https://wordpress.org/support/topic/send-auto-responder-on-step-one-of-multi-step-1?replies=6](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/send-auto-responder-on-step-one-of-multi-step-1?replies=6)


= My forms are not working as expected.  What's wrong? =

- Make sure you have the `multi-step` tag on each and every form.

- It is very common for other plugins to have javascript errors which can prevent this plugin from running properly.  Deactivate all other plugins and try again.

= Previous button leads to 'undefined' =

This is caused by a multistep form tag not having the correct step.  For example your form for step 2 of 3 may have `[multistep "1-3-http://a.com/step-3"]`, but instead it should be `[multistep "2-3-http://a.com/step-3"]`.

= Why "place your cursor at the end of the form" before inserting the multistep tag? =

The `multistep` form tag is a hidden field and tries not to add any spacing to your form.  In this effort, anything directly after this tag may be hidden.  To prevent this, add a carriage return after the `multistep` form tag, or just follow the directions and place the form tag at the end of the form.
